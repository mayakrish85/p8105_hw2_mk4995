## Problem 1

This problem focuses on NYC transit data. The dataset
`NYC_Transit_Subway_Entrance_and_Exit_Data.csv` contains information
related to each entrance and exit for each subway station in NYC.

#### Clean the data

``` r
# Step 1: Read and clean the data: retain line, station, name, station latitude / longitude, routes served, entry, vending, entrance type, and ADA compliance. Convert the entry variable from character (YES vs NO) to a logical variable (the ifelse or case_match function may be useful).

nyc_transit = 
  read_csv("data/NYC_Transit_Subway_Entrance_and_Exit_Data.csv") |> 
  janitor::clean_names() |> 
  select(line, station_name, station_latitude, station_longitude, route1:route11, entry, vending, entrance_type, ada) |> 
  mutate(
    entry = case_match(
      entry, 
      "YES" ~ TRUE, 
      "NO" ~ FALSE)
  )
```

#### Dataset Desciption

The dataset `NYC_Transit_Subway_Entrance_and_Exit_Data.csv` originally
contains 32 columns and 1,868 rows. The variables include the line,
name, station and entrance location by latitude and longitude, entrance
type, ADA compliance, routes served, cross streets, vending
availability, and more. The cleaned dataset `nyc_transit` contains a
subset of the original dataset (with only 19 columns). `nyc_transit`
variables include the line, station name, station latitude and
longitude, routes served, entry, vending, entrance type, and ADA
compliance.

To clean the data, I started by cleaning the names, and then selected
only the necessary columns as noted above. I then used the mutate
function to convert the entry variable from a character type to a
boolean type.

#### Answer questions about data

``` r
# How many distinct stations are there?
distinct_stations = 
  nyc_transit |> 
  distinct(station_name, line) |> 
  nrow()

# How many stations are ADA compliant?
ada_compliant = 
  nyc_transit |> 
  filter(ada==TRUE) |> 
  nrow()

# What proportion of station entrances / exits without vending allow entrance?
prop_vending_entrance = 
  nyc_transit |> 
  summarize(
    proportion = mean(vending == "NO" & entry == TRUE)
  )
```

There are 465 distinct stations. Out of the 1868 subway station
entrances/exits in New York, 468 are ADA compliant. The proportion of
station entrances / exits without vending that allow entrance is
0.0369379.

``` r
# Reformat data so that route number and route name are distinct variables.
reformatted_nyc_transit = 
  nyc_transit |> 
  mutate(
    across(route1:route11, as.character)
  ) |> 
  pivot_longer(
    cols = route1:route11,
    names_to = "route_number",
    names_prefix = "route",
    values_to = "available_route"
  )


# How many distinct stations serve the A train?
A_train_service = 
  reformatted_nyc_transit |> 
  filter(available_route == "A") |> 
  distinct(station_name, line) |> 
  view()

nrow(A_train_service)
```

    ## [1] 60

``` r
# Of the stations that serve the A train, how many are ADA compliant?
A_train_ADA =
  reformatted_nyc_transit |> 
  filter(ada == TRUE & available_route == "A") |> 
  distinct(station_name, line) |> 
  view()
  
nrow(A_train_ADA)
```

## Problem 2

Start by reading and cleaning the Mr. Trash Wheel Sheet.

``` r
mr_trash_wheel = 
  read_excel("data/202309 Trash Wheel Collection Data.xlsx", sheet="Mr. Trash Wheel", skip = 1)
```

    ## New names:
    ## • `` -> `...15`
    ## • `` -> `...16`
